## Overview

Battery offers a lightweight and streamlined solution for Apple Silicon Mac users to manage their battery's charge limit effectively. By setting a maximum charge threshold, users can proactively extend the lifespan of their device's battery, mitigating the strain caused by constant charging to 100%.

## Background

Limiting the maximum charge of the battery serves the purpose of preserving battery health and safeguarding it from potential damage. Numerous sources indicate that maintaining lithium-ion batteries within an optimal charge range of 40% to 80%, often known as the 40-80 rule, enhances their operational longevity. This project proves particularly beneficial for individuals who habitually keep their Macs plugged in throughout the day.
